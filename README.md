- 👋 Hi, I’m Ramone.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new tech and setting up a homelab to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ProxMox, and using it to run VM's and containers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects relating to homelabs
- 📫 I can be reached on Telegram: https://t.me/IAMTHEREDEEMED
- I'm looking forward to my time here...
